Overview
This project implements a convolutional autoencoder using PyTorch to learn compressed representations of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The model encodes images into a latent space and reconstructs them, which can be useful for tasks like denoising, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection.

Features
CNN-based encoder and decoder architecture

Trains on MNIST dataset (auto-downloads if missing)

Reconstruction loss tracked during training and testing
